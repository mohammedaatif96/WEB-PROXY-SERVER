# WEB-PROXY-SERVER
Web Proxy Server using Python. It is used on the concepts of socket programming in python.
The code enables us to run http websites along with https websites. 
Change your browsers proxy settings and go to IP Address and change it to "localhost" and give the port number as "12345" and Save.
Before running the code load a http website and you will be able to see it won't run.
Next up you run the code and the code asks for the listening port and then you give the port number 12345 assigned in the browser proxy settings. 
A connection is established betweeen the server and the client.
Then you open your browser and load http or https website and then you can see both the websites running and in the terminal you can see the communication between the server and the client. 
Prefer using Mozilla Firefox.
